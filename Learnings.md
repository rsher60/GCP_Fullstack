1) Cloud Build is a service used to automate the build process of your application, including compiling code and creating container images, while Cloud Run is a serverless platform that allows you to deploy and run those containerized applications, essentially focusing on the "running" part of the application once it's built by Cloud Build; meaning Cloud Build handles the construction phase, and Cloud Run handles the execution phase.
